This is a parser for the Lich[1] data format, written in C.
It's not much code (about 150 lines), and intended to be
copied into your project. You need two files:

	lich.h
	lich.c

The interface for this code is small. It's designed in the
same vein as https://github.com/kr/json. In other words,
this parser doesn't do very much; it really only parses.
Doesn't do any converting or creating of higher-level data
structures for you.


How to use it (error handling omitted):

	Lich *elem;
	int nelem;

	nelem = lichparse(src, len, NULL, 0); // 1. count elements
	elem = calloc(nelem, sizeof(Lich));   // 2. allocate them
	lichparse(src, len, elem, nelem);     // 3. parse them

If you know beforehand how many elements to expect, you can
of course skip step 1 above.


Tips for traversing the output data:

 - The children of a Lich array form a linked list. The
   first child of a Lich array at elem[n] is at elem[n+1],
   and the second child is at elem[n+1].next.

 - The keys and values of a Lich dictionary form two linked
   lists. The first key and value in dict at elem[n] are at
   elem[n+1] and elem[n+2], and the second ones are at
   elem[n+1].next and elem[n+2].next.
